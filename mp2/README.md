**Usage**

To run the application, open a terminal on each machine that will be used. If a single machine will act as both a client and a server, a separate terminal must be opened for the client and server respectfully.
In each terminal, navigate to /home/mjmoy2/mp2/src.
Please check to make sure you are in the main branch.
For each Server, compile using javac SimpleServer.java, then start the server with java Server.
For each client, compile using javac MainApplication.java, then start the client using java client.
